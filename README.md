# BetterMoodleSchedule
Chrome Extension which enhances the public Moodle schedule

## Desired features
- Remove entire courses from the schedule
- Remove a specific/unique event in the schedule
- Add a new event to the schedule
- Change time of event in schedule (fx useful when you have statusseminar)

All of the above is meant to be synced with the Chrome Storage module.
